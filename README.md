# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

This analysis had the purpose of creating a summary of the amount of weekly fares broken down by city types. For this analysis the frame of dates were broken down to the beginning of January and the end of April in year 2019. The analysis shuffled between three city types to assist with the ride sharing app, "Pybear", in order to make decisions that would greatly improve the company.

### Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

This line chart shows the difference in fare prices over a certain time period:

The type "Urban" has the highest volume of fares between the three city types. Following in second is the "Suburban" city type and finally the "Rural".

Although the "Urban" city type has the highest volume we can see below that the Highest fare per ride actually belongs to the "Rural" city type with the average fare costing about $34.62 a ride.

### Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
Based on the data, three suggestion concerning "Pybear" are brought up.
  - The amount of drivers surpasses the amount of rides, decreasing of drivers may increase the amount of money the remaining drivers get.
  - This is especially true in Urban types as the amount of drivers are causing the amount of money each driver gets to be minimal($0.67 per driver).
  - Moving some of these drivers to Rural areas would decrease the amount of pay the drivers get now but it would be spread out more evenly for everyone. This may just be neccessary between February and March as that range has the highest amount of riders in the data selection.
